This JavaScript code uses jQuery to fetch a JSON file containing a list of blacklisted email domains and then applies validation rules to multiple forms. The validation logic is built using the `jQuery Validate` plugin, with custom methods and rules for validating email domains, required fields, and other form inputs.

### Key Features of the Code:

1. **Fetching Blacklisted Domains:**
   - The code fetches a JSON file containing a list of blacklisted email domains.
   - These domains are used to validate that the email entered by the user is not from a blacklisted domain.

2. **Custom Email Validation:**
   - A custom validation method, `validDomain`, is added to check if the email domain is in the blacklist.
   - If the domain is blacklisted, the user is prompted to "Please enter a business email."

3. **Form Validation Setup:**
   - Multiple forms (`#ebooksForm`, `#requestDemoForm`, `#newsletterForm`, `#salesForm`, `#securityForm`) are targeted for validation.
   - Each form has specific rules for required fields, valid email formats, and agreement to privacy policies.
   - Custom error messages are provided for each validation rule.

4. **Error Placement:**
   - The `errorPlacement` function ensures that validation error messages are placed appropriately based on the form structure.
   - Specific error placement is handled for checkboxes and other elements with custom attributes.

5. **Highlighting Errors:**
   - When a validation error occurs, the corresponding input field is highlighted (e.g., adding an `error-border` class).
   - For checkboxes, a class `error-checkbox` is added to visually indicate the error.

6. **Unhighlighting on Correction:**
   - When the user corrects an error, the highlighting is removed, restoring the formâ€™s original appearance.

### Example Usage:
If the user enters an email like `user@gmail.com` on any of the forms, the code will:
- Check if `gmail.com` is in the list of blacklisted domains.
- If it is, the form will not submit, and the user will see a message like "Please enter a business email."

This setup is particularly useful for ensuring that users enter valid, business-related information, which can help in maintaining the quality of the data collected through these forms.
