This JavaScript code listens for the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before attaching an event listener to a form submission. The script checks a specific condition related to the number of employees and conditionally opens a Calendly URL based on the user's input. Below is a breakdown of the key parts of the code:

### Key Functionalities:

1. **Form Selection:**
   - The code selects the form with the ID `requestDemoForm`.

2. **Event Listener for Form Submission:**
   - It attaches an event listener to the form's `submit` event, which triggers when the user submits the form.

3. **Storing Form Data:**
   - The value from the `demoEmployees` field is stored in `localStorage` for later use.

4. **Conditional URL Redirection:**
   - If the number of employees is not within the specified range ('1-10' or '11-50'), the code constructs a Calendly URL with the user's first name, last name, and email. It then opens this URL in a new tab after a 2-second delay.

5. **Preventing Default Form Submission:**
   - If the condition is met (i.e., the number of employees is not in the specified range), the default form submission is prevented by returning `false`.

### Code Walkthrough:

1. **DOM Ready Event:**
   - The `DOMContentLoaded` event ensures that the script runs only after the DOM has fully loaded.

2. **Form Submission Handling:**
   - When the form is submitted, the code retrieves and stores the value of the `demoEmployees` input field in `localStorage`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - If the `demoEmployees` value is neither '1-10' nor '11-50', the code proceeds to construct the Calendly URL and opens it in a new tab.

4. **Delayed Execution:**
   - The `setTimeout` function introduces a 2-second delay before opening the Calendly URL. This delay can be adjusted as needed.

5. **Return False to Prevent Form Submission:**
   - Returning `false` at the end of the event listener prevents the form from being submitted if the condition is not met.
